      <description>I am a Software Engineer at Cloudera, where I am part of the Internal Systems Engineering team. Specifically, I am in the Tools sub-team, where I work on developing and maintaining tools for the internal support organization.
Before joining Cloudera, I worked at BlackRock briefly as a Software Engineer. There, I worked as part of the Portfolio Management team as well as Securities Lending team.
Prior to joining BlackRock, I was a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science at New York University.</description>
