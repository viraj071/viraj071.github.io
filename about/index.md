# About Me


I am currently a Software Engineer at WePay working in the Risk Infrastructure team. This team is mainly responsible for developing services that help us detect fraud by reviewing payments and help decrease fraud losses for the company.

Before joining WePay, I was part of the Internal Systems Engineering team. Specifically, I am in the Tools sub-team, where I worked on developing and maintaining tools for the internal support organization.

Before joining Cloudera, I worked at BlackRock briefly as a Software Engineer. There, I worked as part of the Portfolio Management team as well as Securities Lending team.

Prior to joining BlackRock, I was a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science at New York University.
