      <description>I was solving the problem Largest Divisible Subset on Leetcode a while back.
The problem is as follows:
Given a set of distinct positive integers, we need to find the largest subset of this set such that every pair(E1, E2) of elements in that set satisfy one of the following conditions:
 E1 % E2 == 0 E2 % E1 == 0  If there are multiple such subsets, we can return any one of them.</description>

      <description>I was solving a problem called Wiggle Subsequence on leetcode today.
I spent sometime thinking of the solution to the problem before I realized that there was a similar named problem I had solved recently. Longest Increasing Subsequence.
One of the solutions to the problem runs in O(n2) time. That solution calculates the longest increasing subsequence of a given index i by checking the longest increasing subsequence for all indices j &amp;lt; i for which nums[i] &amp;gt; nums[j].</description>
